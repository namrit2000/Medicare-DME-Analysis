# Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Analysis

This project explores the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment (DME), Devices, and Supplies dataset to uncover patterns in usage, payments, and supplier distributions across the United States.

## Objectives
- Analyze geographical and service-level patterns in Medicare DME reimbursements.
- Apply statistical tests to evaluate disparities and correlations.
- Build visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Perform clustering to detect hidden patterns in supplier/provider behavior.

## Dataset
- Source: [data.gov](https://data.gov)
- Rows: 42,079
- Key Features: Provider geography, HCPCS codes, Medicare payment amounts, supplier claims.

## Key Methods
- ðŸ“Š Correlation Heatmap, Violin Plot, Boxplot, Countplot
- ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression & T-Test
- ðŸ“Œ K-Means Clustering for provider segmentation

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SciPy, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Scope
- Time series trend analysis
- Linking payments to patient outcomes
- Regional comparison with private healthcare data
